# Abstract

Randomised control trials are the most deployed clinical trials used to test an intervention's effectiveness. In such a setting, participants are randomly assigned to a treatment or a control group. A cluster randomised trial (CRT) is a type of RCT where groups are randomly assigned to either a treatment or a control group. CRTs are increasingly being deployed across various sectors including education, health, and the social sciences. In this regard, CRTs have proved specifically useful when the effect of the intervention is measured at the population or group level, and the outcome of the intervention relates to the interaction between groups.

This work explores the main components and considerations in the design of a CRT and also demonstrates how multilevel model analysis techniques are applied in the analysis of a CRT. The MENISCUS trial is used as a case study to highlight how a CRT can be designed and analysed. The data set used for this analysis is an abstraction of the baseline dataset from the Menstrual health interventions, schooling, and mental health problems among Ugandan students (MENISCUS trial).
